2000000107	These aren't Shango's tracks.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000000108	These tracks must belong to Shango.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005000	Poor Dorius. If I ever get my hands on those Dark Irons, so help me...	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005001	Opus wants some Cuergo's Gold... with worm.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005002	Bijou lost! SQUAWK! *cough	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005003	Kibler is being investigated by G.E.T.A.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005004	Bijou knows where treasures are hidden.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005005	Dragons controlling orcs!? SQUAWK!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005006	They all go to the Spire but none never come back... just like Bijou.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005007	Ask Kibler about the treasure! SQUAWK!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005008	SQUAWK!! *cough* *cough* I need to quit smoking!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005011	Yes right away momma!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005012	Mysterious hoofprints, scorched shields, stray badges... how do we make sense of all this?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005013	I don't think Drazzit's going to have any luck finding anyone to kill this raptor. I mean, he's already raised the reward twice...	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005014	But this the only building that fit Brogg! Goblins make buildings too small!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005015	I thought we talked about this, Brogg. You can't stay in this building. Sure, it can house you, but there's no room for anyone else!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005016	Yes, we said you can stay here, but this building is our headquarters! All of our manuals and blueprints are stored here!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005017	I'm inclined to say they made ogres too big! I can see I'm not going to convince you to move now, but don't think this is permanent!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005018	Ah, this must be him now... no?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005019	You might wanna stand back. Fish guttin' is a dirty job.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005020	It's good to see you defending Theramore with pride, friend.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005021	When you're off duty, let's go to the inn. I'll buy a round and we can reminisce about the good old days.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005022	Wouldn't you like to bring those days back? I have some friends who know just the way to do that.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005023	Every item that I have for sale I acquired myself. You have my personal guarantee of authenticity.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005027	The Lich King's forces are building. It is imperative that our timetable supports his plans.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005028	Tomorrow we will begin training of our promising dragons, so don't forget your chew toys.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005029	Our oldest clutch of dragons are still far from maturity, but with patience and study, we are confident the dragons will soon be ready.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005030	If you wait to come see me, there may be nothing left!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005031	I come from the land down under... where women plague and men sunder.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005032	...And then the tauren said, "13 INCHES!"	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005036	Please! I must feed on something soon... A mana crystal... a shard... anything! The pain is unbearable!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005037	I might just have to go hunting for that Wretched beast now that there's a bounty on his head.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005038	Tell us! Where does you leader hide?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005039	The wind speaks of our enemies' movements, Ashyen. The Naga will attack again.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005040	Very well. When that decision is made, I will be ready. Let us hope it won't be too late.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005041	I will do my best to take care of the children, Grandmother.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005048	Having a good time?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005049	I have another reading from the nether.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005050	Well hand it overand let's see what you got!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005103	Jack and Jill my wrinkled patoot! I do all the water luggin round here.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005104	Wheres the water Emma? Get the water Emma? Ifn it werent fer me that lot wouldnt know what water looks like.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005105	Of Course Im talking to myself. Only way to get a decent conversation in this city.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005106	As if I dont have better things to do in my old age than carry buckets of water.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005107	Seems like a hundred times a day I walk all the way to get more water. No respect for their elders I tell ya.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005108	Deja vu. For a moment I thought I was back home... before the plague...	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005109	They say he can turn into a raven sometimes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005110	They say he can turn into a raven sometimes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005111	And then the rabbit just bit his head off... I swear.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005112	I swear, people have actualy seen them. Pandaren really do exist!!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005113	You know why Orcs eyes glow red? It's because they drink blood!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005114	I dont think there's any fish in these canals.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005115	And that's how Lother killed thirty six orcs with his bare hands!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005116	Eww... that's not a fish!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005117	I got worm guts on my shoes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005118	I think i see something.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005119	Eww... that's not a fish!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005120	I think i see something.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005121	I hope that was a fish!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005122	Worm goes on the hook, hook goes in the water, Fish is in the water, our fish.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005123	Can you imagine?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005124	Really?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005125	Wow.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005126	My father says that's just a story.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005127	Really?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005128	Wow.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005129	That's neat.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005130	Wow.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005131	Really?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005132	Look alive, dogs! We got an operation to run here!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005133	Having a good time?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005134	Here we have the Cathedral of Light, the center of spiritual enlightenment here in Stormwind.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005135	Yes, that is true. Paladins and Priests alike train their skills and research great truths behind the walls of the Cathedral.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005136	Children if you would please follow me, we will now be going to see the keep where King Anduin Wrynn himself sits on this throne.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005137	Here we have Stormwind Keep. Built upon the ruins of Stormwind Castle, which was destroyed by the Horde in the first Great War.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005138	When the Horde was shattered, men returned here and began to rebuild the once great city as a testament to our own survival.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005139	Yes, well...let's head on to the monument dedicated to the heroes of the two Great Wars, the Valley of Heroes. Follow Me.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005140	Isn't it amazing, children? All who enter the city must walk beneath the watchful eyes of the greatest heroes of our lands.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005141	Breathtaking. Children, when we return to the school, you will each give an oral report on one of these legendary people.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005142	Now, take another long look before we make our way to the Holy District and the great Cathedral of Light.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005143	This will never do..	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005144	This must be fixed!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005145	How can anyone live like this!?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005146	Duck!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005147	Don't go close to the lake! It's haunted!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005148	Putting in twelve centers of focus might allow the magical energies to form more solidly, adding the necessary stability.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005149	At least we would not be around to have to clean it up.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005150	Only if we did not follow the proper initialization procedures.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005151	The resultant energies could collapse though, and that could cause an energy flux that would give you a migraine for weeks.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005152	Only if we did not follow the proper initialization procedures.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005153	Only if we did not follow the proper initialization procedures.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005155	But isn't that what caused the initial problems with Adept Syleria's magical formula?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005156	I suppose that could work, if we had twenty people to cast it with.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005157	But what if the resulting frequency shift were to send magical feedback up the flows?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005158	When the positively aligned energies collide with the negatively charged energies, they don`t negate one another.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005159	That will unbalance the magical focus, though, and cause a reverse vibration in the ether.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005160	But wouldn`t that mean crossing the streams? Isn`t that really bad?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005161	Why can't we just shift the array to compensate for the variance in the flux?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005162	But isn't that what caused the initial problems with Adept Syleria's magical formula?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005163	I think not, I don't need to be blown up again.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005164	Maginor says that twisting alternating flows of positive energy actually creates a much more stable flow.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005165	But wouldn`t that mean crossing the streams? Isn`t that really bad?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005166	But isn't that what caused the initial problems with Adept Syleria's magical formula?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005167	Is it true that the paladins train here?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005168	Why do we have to learn this stuff anyway?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005169	If we reverse the Essence flows perhaps we can alter the polarity.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005170	What if we used three focuses in Tyrean pattern? That should solve it.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005171	Wow, all this for a love potion. Hope he is worth it.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005172	If we use the appropriate sequence we should be ok. Will just take some serious studying before we start.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005173	The Portal will shift slightly. At this point if you cast a binding cantrip you will solidify it in place.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005174	Wow, all this for a love potion. Hope he is worth it.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005175	But if we stabilize it with an anchor thread at the appropriate energy crux then it should work.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005176	What if we used three focuses in Tyrean pattern? That should solve it.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2000005401	*sigh* It's about time to check on the cemetary again-- Ill be back in a few minutes.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005402	How long can it take to pick a handful of weeds?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005403	At this rate I could have gathered them myself!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005404	Ah, this must be him now... no? Bah!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005405	As if I had all eternity.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005406	We're running low on iron, lads! I don't want to see a single bar go to waste, ye hear me now?	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005407	Not bad. Try that trick I told you about when you temper the steel.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
2000005408	Stonemasons. . .errr. . Defias be warned: The rusty anchor sinks tonight.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
